/*
 * USB keyboard/mouse support via UHCI/OHCI/EHCI legacy emulation.
 *
 * Modern BIOSes (and VirtualBox/QEMU) implement "USB Legacy Support":
 * they emulate USB HID devices as PS/2 through the 8042 controller,
 * so our PS/2 driver already handles USB keyboards transparently.
 *
 * For xHCI (USB 3.x) hosts that don't emulate PS/2, we need to
 * hand off to xHCI legacy support via the xHCI Extended Capabilities.
 * We do that here by scanning PCI for xHCI and writing the OS Owned
 * semaphore so the BIOS releases the controller to us — after which
 * the BIOS's SMI handler continues to feed scancodes into port 0x60.
 *
 * Mouse: In text mode there is no graphical cursor, so we read mouse
 * packets and expose delta/button state for future use, but we don't
 * render anything (no pixel framebuffer in text mode).
