/*
 * Compressed memory, a swap in RAM (64-bit kernel). When memory runs low,
 * pages of apps' mmap regions (a Java heap...) that were not used lately
 * are compressed into the kernel heap and their page goes back to the
 * system (kernel/upage.c); touching one again decompresses it in the page
 * fault (kernel/uspace.c), on any core. An all-zero page takes no room.
 * Windows 10 and Linux (zram, zswap) do the same before - or instead of -
 * writing pages to a disk.
 *
 * A compressed page is an entry of a table: its page table entry holds the
 * entry's number. While a page is being compressed the entry still holds
 * the page itself (PENDING): a touch then simply puts it back.
