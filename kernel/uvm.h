/*
 * Memory an app maps itself (mmap, 64-bit kernel): a region of virtual
 * addresses of its own, UVM_BASE .. UVM_BASE + UVM_SIZE, outside the
 * identity map of kernel/uspace.c. A mapping only reserves addresses; a
 * page gets memory (zeroed, from the app's own blocks: kernel/umem.c) the
 * first time it is touched, by the app or by a system call working for it.
 * So a program can reserve a big range (a Java heap) and use a little of
 * it. Each range has its protection - none, read, read + write (execute
 * goes with read: the kernel does not turn on NX) - and touching a page
 * against it faults like any bad access.
 *
 * The 32-bit kernel has no paging: kernel/app.c hands out ordinary
 * (zeroed) app memory there, without reservations or protection.
